#Rock Paper Scissors
###A Javascript Project

This is a simple "Rock Paper Scissors" game, made with vanilla Javascript. 

For this project, i implemented simple notions of DOM Manipulation, functions, array manipulation, and generally speaking intermediate Javascript so the game is playable. 

####How to play

Choose one of the buttons and test your chance! As soon as you pick one of the options, the amazing computer will pick one too, and according to the choices, a winner is declared, or if by chance the choices are the same, then it's a draw. 

######Future versions will feature visual improvements, but since this first one emphasizes development with javascript, i will leave it with a basic HTML structure.
